## Problem Statement
Citi Bike is the nation's largest bikeshare program. They publish [public data](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) containing trip records of bike usage across New York City. This project demonstrates how to build an end-to-end data engineering pipeline on Google Cloud Platform by batch processing the data monthly. A dashboard will utilize the data to provide helpful insights on ridership trends and station usage.
